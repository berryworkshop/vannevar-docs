    - initial critiques
        - librarian focused: boring
        - I want an adventure site
        - information not in context: too much raw data
        - centered on an expert and his take on things
        - too verbose
        - no people/individuals
        - data on public libraries not useful except in aggregate
        - search not centric
        - a technological island
