* Institutions and community nodes
* Tools
* Collections


## General Strategy
1. Lay a firm foundation 
1. Carefully choose bedrock data
1. Crowd-source, but verify
1. Depth over Breadth
1. Bite-sized contributions
1. Maintain sources for scholarly reference
1. Maintain public access to general services
1. Monetize APIs and services
1. Maintain and use rich APIs
    1. pull and push data via social media


## Development methodology
Initially: Spiral, iterative process
    planning --> analysis --> evaluation --> development --> (repeat)
Tracer bullets over prototypes:  real working code
Once requirements and deadlines established, switch to semi-waterfall


## Roadmap
* 1.0: Get the damn thing running
    * Local coverage: Chicago and the Midwest
        * avoid codifying content scope
    * Perfect system core: data entry and structure
    * MVC: Minimum Viable Content
    * Unit and integration tests
* 2.0: Identify core community
    * Usability testing
    * Consult a lawyer
    * Locate and integrate collaborators
* 3.0: Public push
    * Publicize
    * Get some grants

* a museum professional wondering how a specific tool compares
* me when running tutorials at Code4Lib


## Inspiration
* Internet Movie Database
    - model for user-submitted, interconnected, and browsable data, with people, institutions, and creative works represented
    - http://imdb.com
* iFixit
    - model for graphical, step-by-step, modular tutorials
    - http://ifixit.com/
* Atlas Obscura
    - model for exploration and adventure: an experiential site
    - http://www.atlasobscura.com/
* libraries.org
    - model for a comprehensive library directory
    - http://librarytechnology.org/libraries/
    - initial critiques
        - librarian focused: boring
        - I want an adventure site
        - information not in context: too much raw data
        - centered on an expert and his take on things
        - too verbose
        - no people/individuals
        - data on public libraries not useful except in aggregate
        - search not centric
        - a technological island
